* who is in there ? 
* a crosstab with gender, profession, graduation, marriage

5. Imputing and creating clean file
* imputation choices for numeric but discrete categories 
* new categorical variables

6. Recreating high spending and crosstab tables for comparison after imputation 

7. Preparing presentation and readme.md file 


## Files in this repository 
* CSV and xlsx files for both versions of the new markets data ; the high spending category; the crosstab analysis
